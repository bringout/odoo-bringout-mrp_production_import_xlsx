Below is the result of carrying-out **steps 1 and 2** of the plan: a focused scan of the three public GitHub organisations (OCA, Cybrosys Technologies and Odoomates) for add-ons that already offer, or come close to offering, an XLS/XLSX “Manufacturing Order (mrp.production) import” feature.

====================================================================
1. OCA – Odoo Community Association
====================================================================

Search strings used
• mrp production import
• mrp_production_import
• production_import
• import_xls, import_xlsx inside the OCA “manufacture-*”, “mrp”, “stock-logistics-*” and “misc” repos.

Findings

✔︎ Modules that import other MRP-related objects (but **not** manufacturing orders)
  • manufacture/mrp_bom_import_xls – BOM import from XLS.
  • manufacture/mrp_bom_xlsx – XLSX import/export of BOMs.
  • manufacture/mrp_bom_available – reads XLSX but again only for BoMs.

✔︎ Generic import helpers you could reuse
  • stock-logistics-import/stock_picking_import – CSV wizard ⇒ good reference for file upload, parsing, error reporting.
  • sale-workflow/sale_order_import – same idea for sales orders (CSV).

✘ No module whose name or code targets the model mrp.production.
  – No hit for mrp_production_import, mrp_production_xlsx, manufacturing_order_import, etc.

Conclusion for OCA
There is currently **no ready-made OCA module** that imports manufacturing orders from XLS/XLSX; however, the BOM- and SO/PO-import add-ons provide patterns you can copy (wizard, transient model, error log).

====================================================================
2. Cybrosys Technologies
====================================================================

Search strings used
• mrp production import xlsx site:github.com/Cybrosys
• “class MrpProduction” and “import excel” inside their repos.

Findings

✔︎ Some generic Excel import utilities
  • cybrosys/odoo-addons/product_excel_import
  • cybrosys/odoo-addons/sale_order_import
  • cybrosys/odoo-addons/purchase_order_import

✔︎ A handful of MRP-oriented Excel utilities
  • manufacturing_bom_excel_import – imports BoMs, not MO’s.
  • mrp_components_report_xlsx – report/export only.

✘ Nothing for mrp.production import.
  – No repo contains a module whose manifest declares ‘mrp’ and whose code creates manufacturing orders from spreadsheet data.

Conclusion for Cybrosys
Cybrosys offers several Excel‐import wizards, but **none aimed at Manufacturing Orders**. Their sale/purchase import modules still provide a useful blueprint.

====================================================================
3. Odoomates
====================================================================

Search strings used
• production import in org:odoomates
• xlsx import in org:odoomates

Findings

✔︎ Excel importers for other documents
  • odoomates/odooapps/sale_order_line_import
  • odoomates/odooapps/chart_of_accounts_import

✘ No evidence of a manufacturing-order import utility.
  – No module touching the mrp.production model.

Conclusion for Odoomates
No existing add-on that meets the requirement; but their import wizards (sale order line, COA) illustrate a clean, modern code structure you can mimic.

====================================================================
Overall conclusion of Steps 1 & 2
====================================================================

• None of the three well-known sources delivers an “MRP Production XLS/XLSX Import” out-of-the-box.
• Closest relatives are BOM and stock-/sale-/purchase-import wizards (OCA) and various generic Excel import utilities (Cybrosys, Odoomates).
• These relatives provide reusable patterns (wizard definition, transient model, file‐upload widget, parser, error feedback) which will accelerate the development of your own module.

Accordingly, you can proceed to step 3 (review/reuse code structure) knowing that you will have to create a new module, not just install an existing one.
